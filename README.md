## Description
- This application is the final assessment project for the COSC2659 - iOS Development course at RMIT University, Vietnam. 
- The project serves as a practical demonstration of the skills and knowledge acquired throughout the course, covering key aspects of iOS application development.

## Key Features:
- Proximity-based Accident Alerts: Roadify stands out for its proximity-based notifications, which notify users when they are near a recently reported traffic accident. This real-time, location-specific function is intended to assist users in avoiding unsafe locations and provides more instant relevance than general traffic apps.
- Roadify's app allows users to simply record accidents, resulting in a real-time database of traffic incidents. This makes the app especially appealing to users who wish to contribute to safer roads while also benefiting from the information offered by others.
